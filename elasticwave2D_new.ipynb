    "### Background \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook simulates  dynamic earthquake ruptures and elastic wave propagation in two space dimensions (2D). Spontaneously propagating shear ruptures on a frictional interface in an elastic solid is a useful idealization of natural earthquakes. The conditions relating slip-rate and fault strength are often expressed as nonlinear friction laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "During an earthquake, two sides of the fault, initially held in contact by a high level of frictional resistance, slip suddenly when that resistance catastrophically decreases, generating strong ground shaking which is carried by seismic waves to remote areas, far away from fault zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes and implements a high order accurate finite difference method for enforcing nonlinear friction laws in a consistent and provably stable manner, suitable for efficient explicit time integration and accurate propagation of seismic waves in heterogeneous media with free surface boundary conditions.\n",

    "On the fault there is the velocity vector $\\left(v_{n}, v_{m}\\right)=\\left(v_{x}, v_{y}\\right)$, and the traction vector $\\left(T_{n}, T_{m}\\right)=\\left(\\sigma_{xx}, \\sigma_{xy}\\right)$, where $v_{n}$, $T_{n}$ are the normal components and $v_{m}$, $T_{m}$ being the shear components on the  interface. Denoting the fields in the positive and the negative parts of the fault with the superscripts $\\pm$, we introduce the jumps in particle velocities by $\\lbrack{v_j}\\rbrack = {v_j}^{+}-{v_j}^{-}$, with $j = m, n$, and  the total traction by $T_j = T_{0j} + \\Delta{T_j}$, where $T_{0j}$ are the initial background tractions and $\\Delta{T_j}$ are the traction changes on the fault.

    "\n",
    "There are three modes of fracture as illustrated below. Mode I fracture is an in plane motion where the direction of movement is perpendicular to the fracture itself, this opening can be described by a single component tensile component. Mode II is an in plane fracture that moves parallel to the fracture, it can be described by a compressive component that is perpendicular to the fracture (non-opening) and another parallel component that is creating shearing forces. This is a widely used mode for rupture dynamics because, both P and S waves emanate from this mode. This can allow 'super shear' ruptures, shear ruptures propagating above the S wave velocity. Mode III is an out of plane shearing motion and can be described in one out of plane component. This mode of rupture has a strict upper bound of the S wave velocity. Since earthquakes don't open wide chasms into the earth, mode I is not used here. <br/>\n",

    "\n",
    "It is necessary to consider the role of friction in all of this because it modulates the stresses and slip speed as the separate sides of the fault slip past each other. The first thing to consider is that as the fault slips it experiences shear strength ${\\tau}$ which is exerted by the normal stresses on the fault ${\\sigma_n}$. The way these two variables are related is through the friction coefficient ${f}$: ${\\quad} {\\tau} = f \\cdot {\\sigma_n}$. \n",

    "#### Slip Weakening Friction\n",
    "Slip weakening friction describes a friction behavior in which friction coefficient weakens linearly with slip.  When the fault is at rest the friction coefficient is denoted by static friction coefficient ${f_s}$, when the fault is in motion the friction coefficient is denoted by the dynamic friction coefficient ${f_d}$. An earthquake begins when the load $\\tau$ at a finite patch on the fault overcomes the peak frictional strength, $\\tau \\ge \\tau_p$, ${\\quad \\tau_p = f_s \\cdot \\sigma_n}$.  As the earthquake continues the fault surfaces slide relative to each other  and the frictional coefficient evolves from linearly from static friction coefficient $f_s$  to the dynamic friction coefficient ${f_d}$. The fault is fully weakened when the slip reaches the critical slip ${D_c}$. This can be seen in the figure above which plots the friction coefficient as a function of slip.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Rate and State Friction\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate and state friction is a constitutive law that was empirically found and is considered more realistic than slip weakening. It takes the form:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " &\\tau = \\sigma_n \\cdot f(V, \\theta), \\quad f(V, \\theta) = [ f_0 + a \\cdot ln(\\frac {V}{V_0}) + b \\cdot ln( \\frac{V_0 \\theta}{D_c})], \\\\\n",
    "  &\\frac {d \\theta}{dt} = G(V, \\theta).\n",
    " \\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation ${V}$ is the current slip velocity and ${V_0}$ is a reference slip velocity while ${f_0}$ is the steady state friction coefficient at the reference velocity: ${f_{V= V_0}}$. There is the state variable ${\\theta}$, and the state evolution law $G(V, \\theta)$. We consider specifically the aging law: ${ G(V, \\theta) = 1 - \\frac {V\\theta }{D_c}.\\quad}$ At steady state the state variable is proportional to the critical distance divided by velocity ${ \\theta_{ss} = \\frac {D_c}{V}}$  <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here ${a}$ is the *direct effect* and is used to model how the system responds to velocity changes. ${b}$ is the *evolution effect* and describes the magnitude of the steady state friction.  ${D_c}$ is the critical distance and corresponds to the slip length over which the evolution of ${a \\to b}$ occurs. The relationship of ${a}$ and ${b}$ to the slip weakening friction variables is as follows: ${\\quad b = \\frac {df_s}{d(ln(t))} \\quad, \\quad (a-b) = \\frac {df_d}{d(ln(V))} \\quad}$ where ${t}$ is the amount of time of contact without an earthquake. It is interesting to notice that there is a relationship between slip velocity ${V}$ and dynamic friction ${f_d}$ that depends on the difference ${(a-b)}$. If ${(a-b)>0}$ it shows that there is a velocity strengthening relationship ${\\frac {df_d}{d(ln(V))} > 0}$. Any rupture that enters this region will arrest and is called a *stable* region. If ${(a-b)<0}$ it shows that there is a velocity weakening relationship ${\\frac {df_d}{d(ln(V))} < 0}$, this is where earthquakes can nucleate and grow and is called *unstable*. On the border between *stable* and *unstable* regions is a zone of *conditional stability* where ruptures can sustain propagation while not growing or terminating. This notebook only exists in the unstable zone.\n",
    "\n",

    "The equations are discretized using the SBP-SAT finite difference scheme. Time integration is performed using the classical fourth order accurate Runge-Kutta method. For more elaborate discussions, we refer the reader to the references and the  notebooks on the SBP-SAT method. A summary of the numerical implementations used in the this notebook is presentated in the flow-chart below.\n",

    "### Putting it together\n",
    "\n",
    "In the parameter window you can modulate the material properties, run time, domain size, and CFL criterion. In addition, you can choose rate and state friction or slip weakening friction, notice the differences that occur with this choice. In the Calculations and plotting cell the resulting on fault tractions and slip velocities are solved for in the RK4_2D.elastic_RK4_2D function, which also calls on the other associated functions. The bottom cell contains 5 output plots of the rupture behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot that is observed immediately under this cell is the particle velocity plotted in the entire domain. The fault runs vertically through the center of the model and is marked by a vertical line. When this animation finishes the seismograms of the earthquake pop up under this. In the last cell there are three plots that come from the data generated in the previous cell. These three plots show the on fault slip, slip rate, and tractions as they evlove through time. Lastly there is a plot that shows the slip rate on the fault through time.\n",
